Summary: -

I feel pythons ``@staticmethod`` decorator has a bad rep.
But I use it when I write classes, it makes it easier to read code and distinguish where some utility functionality are being used when reading the source, especially if the person using your functionality is looking at the source or ``dir`` because maybe the documentation wasn't sufficient.

I feel it is good karma
